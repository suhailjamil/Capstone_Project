# Real-Time Network Anomaly Detection System
**MS-CISBA Capstone Project**

A modular, locally deployable cybersecurity solution that leverages stream processing, machine learning, and automated threat response for real-time network anomaly detection.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Dockerized pipeline**: Kafka, Suricata IDS, and Python modules orchestrated with Docker Compose.
- **Real-time traffic analysis**: DBSCAN clustering on streaming network features.
- **Mock firewall API**: Automated (simulated) IP blocking for detected anomalies.
- **Hybrid data storage**: Structured features in SQLite, Suricata alerts in JSON logs.
- **Attack simulation**: Built-in traffic generator for testing detection logic.
